# github-playground

A project for learning the github workflow.

Feel free to open pull requests and play around to see how the github workflow works.


## The basic workflow

1. Fork this github repository. Use the "Fork" button on the github page. You have now your own version of this repository you can submit changes to.
2. Clone your fork of the repository, e.g:
```
git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/github-playground.git
``` 
3. Create a local branch that holds your bugfix:
```
git checkout -b my-fix-branch
```
4. Fix the bug!
5. Commit:
```
git add .
git commit -m "I fixed the thing!"
```
6. Push your local commit to your github repository:
```
git push origin my-fix-branch
```
7. Make a pull request on the gitbub page
8. What happens if 2 branches changed one file ?
